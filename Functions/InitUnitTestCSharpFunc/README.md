# InitMapFunc

#### To use this script. You first need to create an azure function solution.

#### Usage
Download the __init.ps1__ file and execute as __administrator__. Provide the function name (solution name) of the visual studio solution. Also provide the Repos basepath

__note!__ the __init.ps1__ file pulls the __UnitTestTemplate.zip__ file from github. So there is no need to download that.
