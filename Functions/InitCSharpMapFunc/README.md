# InitCSharpMapFunc

#### Includes
&bull; Boilerplate code for Function<br>
&bull; Boilerplate code for Unit tests

#### Usage
Download the __init.ps1__ file and execute as __administrator__. Provide the functionAppName (solution name), functionName of the visual studio solution. Also provide the output directory and the businessobject (used at my current employer).

__note!__ the __init.ps1__ file pulls the __InitCSharpMapFunc.zip__ file from github. So there is no need to download that.
