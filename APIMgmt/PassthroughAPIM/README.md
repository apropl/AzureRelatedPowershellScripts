# passthroughAPIM

#### This script generates an api mgmt passthrough template with version, basic policy and yaml pipeline. Optionally it sets an logic app as backend instead of a webservice.

#### Usage
Download the __passthroughAPIM.ps1__ file and execute as __administrator__. 

__note!__ the __passthroughAPIM.ps1__ file pulls the __.zip__-file from github. So there is no need to download that.
